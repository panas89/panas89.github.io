## Build your personal website in 5 minutes

- Fork this repository.
- Change the content in the main markdown files, located in the main app files, to yours.
- Update your information in the .yml file.
- Replace the me.jpg file and me2.gif file with your personal photos.
- Replace the apple-touch-icon-precomposed.png and favicon.ico images with your logo of preference.
- Update the goole-analytics.html file with your account's key (sign in to goole analytics). More information on how to do this [here](https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/).
- Update the disqus_comments.html file with your account's information. More information on how to do this [here](https://github.com/disqus/disqus-install-examples/tree/master/jekyll).
- To publish your website on github pages follow the last 2 steps of my previous post [Build a Static Website with Hakyll and Github](http://panayiotispetousis.com/jekyll/update/2015/12/22/Hakyll-static-website.html).
- I think you are good to go.
